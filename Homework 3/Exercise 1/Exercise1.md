# Exercise 1

## Identification

- Requirement 1:
    - "The room booking service shall provide an overview of all available rooms in the selected university building."
    - Type: It's a functional requirement because it concern a behaviour by a function of the system


- Requirement 2:
    - "Room bookings shall be updated in real-time, that is:
if a user is looking at the overview and another user at the same time books a room, the overview
shall be updated as fast as possible."
    - Type: It's a quality requirement, that can be performance (time) in terms of speed and reliability (availability) in terms of the correct data at correct time and integrity by avoiding double-booking.


- Requirement 3:
    - "Room booking shall only be possible for logged-in users with
respective privileges."
    - Type: It's a quality requirement of the category security (authenticity), as we want *real* persons to book a room. This prevents false booking by bots or untrusted people.

- Requirement 4:
    - "An initial version of the room booking service shall be ready after 5 months,
the first public version must be finished after 1 year."
    - Type: It's a project requirement because it states clearly when and what shall be finished by a certain time

- Requirement 5:
    - "[...] but for the final product, a graphical
representation is required so that users have an easier time using the system."
    - Type: In this project requirement, it also represents a constraint because it specifies to what extend the system must be capable for the end-user in the final product.


## Are requirements clear?

Out of all requirements given in the description, there's a lack of further constraints, e.g., in what type of programming language Klipsias shall be written. Also, it remains unclear whether it should be a mobile app, web app or a chat bot. Unclearly specified phrases such as "simple text-based approach" evokes a sense of a chatbot, while graphical representation may lead to a mobile or web app.
Furthermore, the process requirement are not specified which may lead to arising problems during the development. Finally, it specifies a "component" which optionally needs quality requirements in terms of compatibility with other components in the system.
