# Exercise 2

In this exercise, for the MVC both the observer and singleton pattern has been used.
The observer pattern allows to register/unregister observer which can be notified the change. This is the case when an update in the model occurs and needs to notify the views and also if the view need to notify the controllers.

The singleton pattern is optional but using this we can ensure that only one instance of a class exists.

The code is in the directory _code_.
