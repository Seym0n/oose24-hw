# Exercise 3

The strategy pattern can be realized in modern Java programming by combining the Functionalinterface and Lambda Expressions.

In this example, we can define a strategy in a few lines of a code, in contrast to old programming, by defining a new class for every strategy.

In the example code, we define a strategy to output the word _as it is_ and another strategy that reverses the word in a few lines of code.

The code can be found in directory _code_.
